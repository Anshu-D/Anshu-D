## Projects
I completed several hands-on projects that demonstrate my skills as a data scientist/data analyst. Some of my notable projects include:

[Lending_Club_CaseStudy]: This project involved data cleaning , preprocessing , EDA and visualisation to find the driving variables on a loan default . I used Python, Pandas, and Numpy to preprocess the data and matplotlib and seaborn for visualisation. I  draw out important actionables and the factors that influence BAD Loans which leads huge losses to the company. Communicating these insights would definitely help Lending CLub reduce risky loans.

 This project involved using machine learning algorithms to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company. I used Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn to preprocess the data and train several machine learning models. I then compared the performance of each model to determine the best one for the task.


[Bike_Sharing_Linear_Regression]:  This project involved using machine learning algorithm- Linear Regression to predict demand of the shared bikes in American Market. I used Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn to preprocess the data and train several machine learning models. I then compared the performance of each model to determine the best one for the task.

## Education
I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from University of Delhi. During my time at university,I completed courses in mathematics, computer science, and machine learning.In addition to that i have done certificate courses in Python,SQL,Power BI, ML. To Have a good grip i successfully completed several projects that involved data analysis and visualization and building models using ML.

In this project, I analyzed the performance of a marketing campaign for a financial services company. I used SQL to extract data from a database and Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib <br> to clean, transform, and visualize the data. I identified key insights and made recommendations to <br> improve future marketing campaigns.
