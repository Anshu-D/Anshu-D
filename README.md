## Projects
During my education, I completed several hands-on projects that demonstrate my skills as a data scientist/data analyst. Some of my notable projects include:
 
 <a href="https://github.com/Anshu-D/Anshu-D/blob/main/20230421_0238445.gif"><img width="300" height="200" align='right' src="https://github.com/Anshu-D/Anshu-D/blob/main/20230421_0238445.gif"></a>
</p>

[Project Title]: This project involved using machine learning algorithms to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company. I used Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn to preprocess the data and train several machine learning models. I then compared the performance of each model to determine the best one for the task.

[Project Title]: In this project, I analyzed the performance of a marketing campaign for a financial services company. I used SQL to extract data from a database and Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib <br> to clean, transform, and visualize the data. I identified key insights and made recommendations to <br> improve future marketing campaigns.
