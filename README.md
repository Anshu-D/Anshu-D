# Education
I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from University of Delhi. During my time at university,I completed courses in mathematics, computer science, and machine learning.In addition to that i have done certificate courses in Python,SQL,Power BI, ML. To Have a good grip i successfully completed several projects that involved data analysis and visualization and building models using ML.

# Tools and Technologies
I have experience working with the following tools and technologies:

Programming languages: Python, SQL
Data analysis libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Machine learning libraries: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras
Data visualization tools: Power BI
Database management: MySQL

# Projects
During my education, I completed several hands-on projects that demonstrate my skills as a data scientist/data analyst. Some of my notable projects include:

[Project Title]: This project involved using machine learning algorithms to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company. I used Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn to preprocess the data and train several machine learning models. I then compared the performance of each model to determine the best one for the task.

[Project Title]: In this project, I analyzed the performance of a marketing campaign for a financial services company. I used SQL to extract data from a database and Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib to clean, transform, and visualize the data. I identified key insights and made recommendations to improve future marketing campaigns.
